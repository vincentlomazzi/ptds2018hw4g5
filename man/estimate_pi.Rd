\title{Monte Carlo estimation of Pi}
\usage{
estimate_pi(B = 5000, seed = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{B}{the length one numeric vector specifying the number of simulations.}

\item{seed}{allows the function to have always the same output}
}
\value{
A matrix of two coordinates between -1 and 1 as well as a boolean
output for each iterations
}
\description{
This function makes an approximtion of the number pi based on a
random drawing of points between -1 and 1 and establishes whether they fall or
not within a circle of radius 1.
}
\examples{
estimate_pi(B = 5000)
